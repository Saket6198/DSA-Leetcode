    //also dynamically allocating size is allowed in vector and not in array since array is implemented in the stack part of RAM which has limited memory

    // this doubling up of space allows the push_back() operation to be performed in O(1) time since if it increases size by 1, 
    // it will have to create space and link it up after each push-back operation which is not efficient.
