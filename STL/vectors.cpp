    //also dynamically allocating size is allowed in vector and not in array since array is implemented in the stack part of RAM which has limited memory
    // while vector is located in the heap part of RAM which has very large size.

    // this doubling up of space allows the push_back() operation to be performed in O(1) time since if it increases size by 1, 
    // it will have to create space and link it up after each push-back operation which is not efficient.

    // Note that no data is returned, and if the last element's data is needed, it should be retrieved before pop_back() is called.
    // O(1);

    a4.clear(); // clears all value
